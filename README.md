## Predict Customer Churn using PySpark Machine Learning

Predicting customer churn is a challenging and common problem that data scientists encounter these days. The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every customer-facing business.

#### Problem Statement

The users stream their favorite songs every day either using the free tier that places advertisements between the songs or using the premium subscription model where they stream music as free but pay a monthly flat rate. The users can upgrade, downgrade and cancel the service at any time. Every time the user interacts with the service like playing songs, logging out or liking a song with a thumbs-up, it generates data. All this data contains the key insights for keeping the users happy and helping the business thrive. Itâ€™s our job on the data team to predict which users are at risk to cancel their accounts. If we can accurately identify these users before they leave, our business can offer them discount and incentives, potentially saving our business millions in revenue.
